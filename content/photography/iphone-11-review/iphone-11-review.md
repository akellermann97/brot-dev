The iPhone 11 was a good phone.
## Design

## Triple Sensors
The iPhone 11 Pro came with three rear cameras. The Telephoto (52mm Full Frame
[FF] equivalent)
had such poor performance this generation and was so close to the main sensor's
focal length (26mm FF equivalent) that I don't have any pictures taken with the
camera. The Ultrawide (13mm FF equivalent) was novel and could get you images
simply impossible with the main, so despite its shortcomings, saw a decent
amount of use.

### The Ultrawide Camera
Not too much to say here. I think this was Apple's first attempt at putting an
ultrawide camera on an iPhone. As with the rest of the cameras, feed the sensor
enough light, and you can get good quality images out of it. There was no
focusing at this time, so all you had to do was hope the exposure was right and
fire away. I wouldn't bother with this camera at night, the sensor was too
small and the optics weren't great either. No RAW from this camera in the
iPhone 11 either, but later generations added this feature.
