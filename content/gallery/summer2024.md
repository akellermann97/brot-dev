# Summer 2024

## New York City

Summers in New York City are brutal. Friends and family coming in and out of the city, subways serving as a sauna for only $2.90, and rancid-yet-unidentifiable smells. But at least we have air conditioning.

## Lake Como

A place so many photographers flock to: I couldn't help but add this place to my list. A picturesque lake flocked by houses perched on hills. Right before we went there was a volcano eruption, so visibility was limited. This made it hard to edit the haze for shots across the lake, but depending on wind it was still possible to get some clear shots.

I jumped off the ferry from Como City at a stop called Nesso. I saw people jumping off a stone bridge into crystal-clear water and just had to check it out.

Back on the ferry to another stop. Some more sightseeing: every place was so picturesque that it was hard to figure out what exactly *was* picture-worthy.

Make sure wherever you stay has air conditioning or a dozen or two fans. Nights didn't cool down as much as we hoped in Como City.

## Modena

The smallest city in Italy we stayed in, Modena, was fun. Beautiful old town, delicious food to explore, and plenty of art and museums to go check out.

## Milan

Had less than 24 hours in this city. Word to the wise: if you go in August, a bunch of the restaurants we wanted to go to were closed, but we only found out by reading the notes on the storefronts when we tried eating there.

## Germany

Visiting family in Weimar is something I get to enjoy every summer. It's a much slower pace than any place I've been to on this trip, and it can be nice to visit a smaller city and just spend some time relaxing with Family. Small lunches, ice cream parlors, and plenty of Bratwurst.
