Hey! I'm Alex Kellermann, a Security Engineer based in New York City, Cloud Security, Application Security, and everything in between. German Duolingo Score 58 (and working on it), amateur seamster. This website's a bit of a melting pot of all the things I like to talk about. All opinions are my own!
