The iPhone 11 was a good phone.
## Design

## Triple Sensors, three lenses
The iPhone 11 Pro came with three rear cameras. The Telephoto (52mm Full Frame
[FF] equivalent)
had such poor performance this generation and was so close to the main sensor's
focal length (26mm FF equivalent) that I don't have any pictures taken with the
camera. The Ultrawide (13mm FF equivalent) was novel and could get you images
simply impossible with the main, so despite its shortcomings, saw a decent
amount of use.
### The Main Camera

### The Ultrawide Camera
Not too much to say here. I think this was Apple's first attempt at putting an
ultrawide camera on an iPhone. As with the rest of the cameras, feed the sensor
enough light, and you can get good quality images out of it. There was no
focusing at this time, so all you had to do was hope the exposure was right and
fire away. I wouldn't bother with this camera at night, the sensor was too
small and the optics weren't great either. No RAW from this camera in the
iPhone 11 either, but later generations added this feature.

### The Telephoto
This is a 2x of the normal lens. Oddly enough, I couldn't find any images worth sharing that I took with this lens. I think a combination of not being *that* much longer than the normal wide, combined with a slower aperture and a smaller sensor just made this overall unappealing. Whenever I 

## The RAWs

### RAW vs Processed RAW vs HEIC

## Straight Out of Camera (SOOC)
With good lighting, you can get really punchy images with good color and very little noise.

## Taking Pictures
There were two ways I took photos on this phone:
- Native Camera App
- [Halide](https://halide.cam)

### Halide Mini Review:
Will likely cover Halide in another post, but the short of it is:
- Well Designed
- Well Thought out Features
- Inconsistent Quality throughout the years
- Pricey

I'd give the app itself a 8.1/10, some really unique features, I think the design is one of the best out there, and the experience is quite delightful. But unless you're serious about taking photos on a phone, I wouldn't recommend it because of its subscription model. 

On newer iPhones (such as the iPhone 15 Pro), you can shoot proRAW straight from the native camera app. You could only do this from the iPhone 12 series onward, and you can't shoot regular RAW from this app, so you'll need to download a third-party app to cover that.
